# p8105_hw2_ml5018

This is a README document for homework 2 of p8105, created by Luan Mengxiao.

Here list some basic requirements of this homework.

## Problem 0

This “problem” focuses on structure of your submission, especially the use git and GitHub for reproducibility, R Projects to organize your work, R Markdown to write reproducible reports, relative paths to load data from local files, and reasonable naming structures for your files.

To that end:

* create a public GitHub repo + local R Project; we suggest naming this repo / directory p8105_hw2_YOURUNI, but that’s not required
* create a single .Rmd file named p8105_hw2_YOURUNI.Rmd that renders to github_document
* create a subdirectory to store the local data files, and use relative paths to access these data files
* submit a link to your repo via Courseworks

## Problem 1

This problem uses the FiveThirtyEight data; these data were gathered to create the interactive graphic on this page. In particular, we’ll use the data in pols-month.csv, unemployment.csv, and snp.csv. Our goal is to merge these into a single data frame using year and month as keys across datasets.

## Problem 2

This problem uses the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset, available as an Excel file on the course website.

## Problem 3

This problem uses data collected in an observational study to understand the trajectory of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarkers. Study participants were free of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal aging and the more serious decline of dementia, at the study baseline.

Basic demographic information were measured at the study baseline. The study monitored the development of MCI and recorded the age of MCI onset during the follow-up period, with the last visit marking the end of follow-up. APOE4 is a variant of the apolipoprotein E gene, significantly associated with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The amyloid β 42/40 ratio holds significant promise for diagnosing and predicting disease outcomes. This ratio undergoes changes over time and has been linked to the manifestation of clinical symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
